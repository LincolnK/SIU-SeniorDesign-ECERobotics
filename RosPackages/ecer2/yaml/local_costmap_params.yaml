local_costmap:
  global_frame: map # defines the coordinate frame that the costmap will run in. Same as global costmap
  robot_base_frame: base_link # defines the coordinate frame the costmap uses for the robot. Same as global costmap
  update_frequency: 5.0 # defines frequecy that the costmap will run. Same as global costmap
  static_map: false # costmap will initalize based on map provided to the system. Same as global costmap
  
  publish_frequency: 2.0 # determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information
  rolling_window: true # true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world
  
  width: 6.0 # sets the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap.
  height: 6.0 # Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map,
  resolution: 0.05 # but most of the time we tend to set them equally
